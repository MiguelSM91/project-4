## Project Description
In this project I have analyzed several databases related to drug use, overdoses, addictions, prices and purities. All the data is studied under the geographic perspective and sometimes with gender or time perspective.

## Questions & Hypotheses
I have tried to answer several questions like, Which is the rate of overdoses deaths by country? Which are the addiction rates by country and gender? Is there a correlation between gender different addiction and general gender gap? Which is the typical price and purity for drugs in the world? Which countries have higher prizes and purities? Is there a correlation between price and purity?

## Dataset
I have used datasets from several sources. The main ones are:
-“Opioids, cocaine, cannabis and illicit drugs”(2018). Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser, Our World in Data. https://ourworldindata.org/illicit-drug-use
-“Statistical Bulletin 2020”. European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drugs Addiction. https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/data/stats2020_en
-“The Global Gender Gap Report 2016”. World Economic Forum. http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GGGR16/WEF_Global_Gender_Gap_Report_2016.pdf

## Workflow
The general workflow was: Getting the data, cleaning it and organizing it. After that I started to plot the data, exploring all the possibilities until I had the most suitable ones. Finally I wrote a medium article in which I described all the insights in the most friendly way possible.

## Organization
The repositoy has 3 different folder: the code folder with the python notebook from data cleaning, the data folder with all the raw data obtained from the different sources and the presentation folder with the slides of the official presentation.

## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
